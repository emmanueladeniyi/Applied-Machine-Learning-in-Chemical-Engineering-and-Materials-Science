    "- **Title:** Accelerated discovery of metallic glasses through iteration of machine learning and high-throughput experiments\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Abstract:** With more than a hundred elements in the periodic table, a large number of potential new materials exist to address the technological and societal challenges we face today; however, without some guidance, searching  through this vast combinatorial space is frustratingly slow and expensive, especially for materials strongly influenced by processing. We train a machine learning (ML) model on previously reported observations, parameters from physiochemical theories, and make it synthesis method–dependent to guide high-throughput (HiTp) experiments to find a new system of metallic glasses in the Co-V-Zr ternary. Experimental observations are in good agreement with the predictions of the model, but there are quantitative discrepancies in the precise compositions predicted. We use these discrepancies to retrain the ML model. The refined model has significantly improved accuracy not only for the Co-V-Zr system but also across all other available validation data. We then use the refined model to guide the discovery of metallic glasses in two additional previously unreported ternaries. Although our approach of iterative use of ML and HiTp experiments has guided us to rapid discovery of three new glass-forming systems, it has also provided us with a quantitatively accurate, synthesis method–sensitive predictor for metallic glasses that improves performance with use and thus promises to greatly accelerate discovery of many new metallic glasses. We believe that this discovery paradigm is applicable to a wider range of materials and should prove equally powerful for other materials and properties that are synthesis path– dependent and that current physiochemical theories find challenging to predict.\n",

    "1. Researchers in this paper attempted to address the difficulties associated with exploring an extensive combinatorial space of potential novel materials, particularly metallic glasses, which are heavily impacted by processing using a combination of high-throughout experiments and machine learning models. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Supervised machine learning modeling was used in this study to train a model on previously reported observations and physiochemical theories to guide high-throughput experiments in the search for new metallic glasses.\n",
    " \n",
    "3. The researchers obtained their data from the Landolt-Bornstein (LB) handbook, which contains a large fraction of melt-spinning experiments on metallic glasses performed over the last 50 years. The dataset includes 6780 melt-spinning experiments at 5313 unique compositions, covering various elements, including examples of metal-metal and metal-metalloid glasses. They also used a sputtering dataset that contains examples of metal-metal and metal-metalloid glasses but with fewer elements than the melt-spinning dataset. The sputtering dataset included 411 entries at 393 different compositions, collected from the LB handbook.\n",
    " \n",
    "4. The researchers assessed the performance of their machine learning (ML) model using log-loss accuracy, which is a metric for measuring the performance of a classification model that considers the \"certainty\" of each prediction. The researchers also used a grouping cross-validation test to assess the performance of their ML model in predicting the glass-forming likelihood (GFL) for different synthesis methods such as melt spinning and sputtering. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. One of the limitations of their approach is that while the ML model showed improved accuracy with each iteration, it still relies on the availability of experimental data from high-throughput (HiTp) experiments. The performance of the model is limited by the quality and quantity of the available training data. Another limitation is that the ML model's performance in predicting glass-forming likelihood (GFL) may vary depending on the synthesis method. The researchers observed differences in the performance of the ML model between the melt spinning and sputtering synthesis methods, leading them to justify the use of separate ML models for each method.\n"
